1
The configuration script MUST know the physical network architecture. Define which router is connected
 to which router on which interface
 
2
A choice must be made in the approach followed to address the physical and loopback interfaces of the
 routers.
 • Human defined: The intent file will contain the IP addresses of the interfaces.
 • Automated: The intent file will contain an IP range that will be used for the addressing of the
 physical and loopback interfaces of a given AS. The script will allocate subnets from the specified
 range. It is recommended to provide an IP range for the physical interfaces and another IP range
 for the loopback interfaces.

 3 Protocols
 The intent file MUST describe which Interior Gateway Protocol is used in an AS. The script will auto
matically enable the specified IGP on the routers of the AS.
 The intent file MUST describe to which BGP AS a given router belongs. The intent file MUST
 capture the necessary information for the iBGP sessions and eBGP to be established.
 4 Policies
4.1 BGP Policies
 Specific routing policies are typically applied on BGP sessions based on the business relationship with the
 neighboring AS. The intent file SHOULD capture such policies so that network automation can tweak
 the policies applied on the eBGP sessions accordingly.
